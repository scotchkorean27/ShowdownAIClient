// decide takes in an approximation of the current gamestate, an associative array keyed by choices with choice details as value, and a string to remind you what side you are
// decide should return one of the keys in the array of choices.

// assumepokemon takes a name, level, gender, and the side of the pokemon in order to generate a best-guess estimate of the opponent's stats (which is hidden information)

// digest(line) is a way for you to customize how your agent deals with incoming information.  It doesn't have to do anything, but it can

// getTeam(format) should return the team that the agent plans on using.  This is only relevant if playing in a non-random format.

// All agents should also come with an assumptions object, which will guide how the InterfaceLayer deals with various aspects of hidden information.
